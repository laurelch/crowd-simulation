# 2D Interactive Crowd Simulation

This is the readme for the interactive part of the open source code written for our [MIG 2021 paper]((https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487983.3488298)), Interactive Simulation of Disease Contagion in Dynamic Crowds.

The model combines a social force-based and contact-based crowd simulation with a diffusion model of disease spread to simulate disease spread in crowds.

Details of the algorithm can be found in the Interactive Simulation of Disease Contagion in Dynamic Crowds paper, particularly in section 3.
